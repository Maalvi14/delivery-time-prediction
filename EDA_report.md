## 1. Dataset Overview & Data Quality

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Size**: 1,000 records × 9 features
- **Memory Usage**: 249.64 KB
- **Target Variable**: `Delivery_Time_min` (regression problem)
- **Feature Types**: 3 numerical, 4 categorical, 2 identifiers

### Data Quality Assessment
- ✅ **No duplicate records** found
- ✅ **No duplicate Order IDs** detected
- ✅ **No negative values** in numerical features
- ⚠️ **Missing data**: 3% in 4 columns (Weather, Traffic_Level, Time_of_Day, Courier_Experience_yrs)

### Missing Data Strategy
Applied strategic imputation preserving data integrity:
- **Categorical features**: Mode imputation (Weather='Clear', Traffic='Medium', Time='Morning')
- **Numerical features**: Median imputation (Courier_Experience_yrs=5.0)
- **Rationale**: Small dataset (1,000 rows) requires careful handling to retain maximum information

## 2. Key Patterns & Insights

### Target Variable Analysis (`Delivery_Time_min`)
- **Distribution**: Right-skewed (skewness=0.5073) with mean=56.73 minutes
- **Range**: 8-153 minutes (145-minute span)
- **Variability**: High coefficient of variation (38.9%)
- **Outliers**: 6 extreme values (0.6%) beyond IQR bounds [-4, 116]

### Feature Correlations with Delivery Time
| Feature | Correlation | Strength | Business Impact |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Distance_km | 0.7810 | **Strong Positive** | Primary driver - longer distances = longer delivery times |
| Preparation_Time_min | 0.3073 | Weak Positive | Kitchen efficiency affects total time |
| Courier_Experience_yrs | -0.0891 | Weak Negative | Experienced couriers slightly faster |

### Categorical Feature Insights
- **Weather Impact**: Snowy conditions (67.1 min) vs Clear weather (53.2 min) - 26% increase
- **Traffic Impact**: High traffic (64.8 min) vs Low traffic (52.9 min) - 22% increase
- **Time of Day**: No significant impact (p=0.79) - contrary to expectations
- **Vehicle Type**: No significant impact (p=0.55) - surprising finding

## 3. Outlier Analysis

### Outlier Detection (IQR Method)
- **Delivery_Time_min**: 6 outliers (0.6%) with values 122-153 minutes
- **Other features**: No significant outliers detected
- **Business Context**: Extreme delivery times may represent special circumstances (traffic accidents, weather events, etc.)

### Outlier Handling Strategy
- **Retained outliers**: Small percentage (0.6%) suggests genuine extreme cases
- **Monitoring**: Flag predictions >120 minutes for manual review
- **Model robustness**: Robust algorithms handle outliers better than linear models

## 4. Statistical Assumptions & Transformations

### Distribution Analysis
- **Target variable**: Non-normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk p<0.001)
- **Numerical features**: All reasonably symmetric (|skewness|<0.75)
- **No transformations required**: Features already well-distributed

### Multicollinearity Assessment
- **No problematic correlations**: No feature pairs with |r|>0.7
- **Low multicollinearity**: All features provide unique information
- **PCA Analysis**: 3 components explain 95% of variance (original: 3 features)
