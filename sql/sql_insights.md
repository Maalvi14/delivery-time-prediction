# SQL Insights for Delivery Time Prediction Analysis

After looking at the basic delivery performance queries, I started thinking about what other questions we should be asking. The data has stories to tell beyond just "who's fastest" and "where's slowest."

## What Else Should We Look At?

**Are we getting slower during peak hours?** It's one thing to know which areas are slow, but are we consistently slower during lunch and dinner rushes? This could tell us if we need more drivers during those times or if there's something about peak demand that's breaking our system.

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM d.order_placed_at) AS hour_of_day,
    ROUND(AVG(d.delivery_time_min), 2) AS avg_delivery_time,
    COUNT(*) AS deliveries_count
FROM deliveries d
GROUP BY EXTRACT(HOUR FROM d.order_placed_at)
ORDER BY hour_of_day;
```

**Does traffic make distance worse?** We know traffic slows things down, but does it make long deliveries disproportionately worse? If a 5km delivery takes 30 minutes in light traffic but 60 minutes in heavy traffic, that's different from a 2km delivery taking 15 minutes in light traffic and 25 minutes in heavy traffic. Understanding this relationship could help us set better expectations or adjust our delivery zones.

```sql
SELECT
    d.traffic_condition,
    ROUND(CORR(d.delivery_distance_km, d.delivery_time_min), 2) AS corr_distance_vs_time,
    COUNT(*) AS deliveries_count
FROM deliveries d
GROUP BY d.traffic_condition
ORDER BY corr_distance_vs_time DESC;
```

**Are some regions just more efficient than others?** Maybe it's not about individual drivers being fast or slow, but about entire regions having different efficiency levels. Some areas might have better road layouts, more restaurants clustered together, or different customer density patterns that make deliveries naturally faster.

```sql
SELECT
    dp.region,
    COUNT(DISTINCT dp.delivery_person_id) AS active_drivers,
    COUNT(d.delivery_id) AS total_deliveries,
    ROUND(AVG(d.delivery_time_min), 2) AS avg_delivery_time,
    ROUND(COUNT(d.delivery_id)::FLOAT / COUNT(DISTINCT dp.delivery_person_id), 2) AS avg_deliveries_per_driver
FROM deliveries d
JOIN delivery_persons dp ON d.delivery_person_id = dp.delivery_person_id
WHERE dp.is_active = TRUE
GROUP BY dp.region
ORDER BY avg_delivery_time ASC;
```

The more I think about it, the more I realize that delivery time isn't just about individual performance, it's about understanding the patterns and constraints that affect our entire operation. These questions might reveal opportunities we're missing or problems we didn't know we had.
